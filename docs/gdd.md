# Game Design Document (Minimal)

## 1. High Concept

A cozy, pixel-art action RPG centered on environmental restoration and responsible resource management. The player takes on a structured role focused on restoring damaged ecosystems, supporting local communities, and maintaining planetary balance through non-violent actions and meaningful daily work.

## 2. Design Pillars

- Biocentric approach: the world has intrinsic value beyond player utility.
- Non-lethal conflict: de-escalation and balance instead of killing.
- Systems over content: gameplay emerges from interacting systems.
- Cozy but meaningful: calm pacing with real consequences.
- Purpose-driven work: progression is tied to responsibility, contribution, and care.

## 3. Core Gameplay Loop

Plan Daily Objectives → Explore → Collect & Classify Resources → Fulfill Work Quotas / Restoration Goals → Craft / Upgrade → Engage in Secondary Activities (farming, animals, relationships) → Rest → Repeat

## 4. Player Progression (High Level)

- Skill-based progression (tools, efficiency, traversal).
- Progression through completed work objectives and ecosystem restoration.
- Economic progression through structured tasks and secondary activities.
- Equipment and clothing crafted from recycled or responsibly gathered materials.
