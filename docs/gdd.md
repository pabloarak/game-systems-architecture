# Game Design Document (Minimal)

## 1. High Concept

A cozy, pixel-art action RPG focused on environmental restoration. The player explores different biomes, collecting and recycling waste to restore ecosystems, help local communities, and maintain planetary balance. Conflict is resolved through non-lethal mechanics, emphasizing harmony over destruction.

## 2. Design Pillars

- Biocentric approach: the world has intrinsic value beyond player utility.
- Non-lethal conflict: de-escalation and balance instead of killing.
- Systems over content: gameplay emerges from interacting systems.
- Cozy but meaningful: calm pacing with real consequences.

## 3. Core Gameplay Loop

Explore → Collect & Classify Resources → Restore Environment → Craft / Upgrade → Unlock New Areas & Abilities → Repeat

## 4. Player Progression (High Level)

- Skill-based progression (tools, efficiency, traversal).
- Reputation-based progression with communities and ecosystems.
- Equipment and clothing crafted from recycled materials.

## 5. Game Systems Overview
