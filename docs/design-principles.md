# Design Principles

## 1. Non-Lethal Interaction
Player actions aim to resolve conflict without killing. Progression is based on understanding, mitigation, or avoidance rather than elimination.

## 2. Sustainability-Driven Progression
Advancement comes from responsible resource usage, restoration, and balance, not from unrestricted extraction or domination.

## 3. Purpose-Driven Work
Core progression is tied to meaningful responsibilities, structured objectives, and contribution to the world rather than pure player optimization.

## 4. Systemic Gameplay
Gameplay emerges from the interaction of systems, not scripted sequences or linear content consumption.

## 5. Calm and Intentional Pacing
The game encourages thoughtful decision-making and planning. Time, effort, and resources are limited, making choices meaningful.

## 6. Modularity and Extensibility
Each system is designed to be independent, testable, and replaceable, allowing long-term evolution without systemic breakage.
