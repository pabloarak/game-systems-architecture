# Design Principles

## 1. Non-Lethal Interaction
Player actions aim to resolve conflict without killing.
Progression is based on understanding, mitigation, or avoidance.

## 2. Sustainability-Driven Progression
Advancement comes from responsible resource usage rather than extraction or domination.

## 3. Systemic Gameplay
Gameplay emerges from the interaction of systems, not scripted sequences.

## 4. Calm Pacing
The game encourages thoughtful play over fast reaction or punishment.

## 5. Modularity
Each system is designed to be independent, testable, and replaceable.
