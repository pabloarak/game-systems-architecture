# Gameplay Systems

This directory contains design documents and implementations
of independent gameplay systems.

Each system is designed to:
- Be modular and self-contained.
- Expose clear inputs and outputs.
- Avoid direct dependency on narrative or world-specific data.

Systems are documented individually as they are explored.
