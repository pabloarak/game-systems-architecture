# Game Systems Lab

This repository explores the design and architecture of modular gameplay systems,
with a focus on:

- Non-violent player interactions.
- Sustainable progression mechanics.
- System-first design.
- Long-term extensibility.

The goal is to document and prototype reusable systems that can be applied
to different game contexts, independent of narrative or setting.

This is a technical and design exploration, not a complete game.
